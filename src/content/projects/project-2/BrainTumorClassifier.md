## Description

- Developed a machine learning project focused on brain tumor classification, specifically identifying glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, or no tumor, using medical imaging data.  
- Implemented data preprocessing techniques, including image augmentation and normalization, to enhance model performance and robustness in tumor classification tasks.  
- Designed and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, achieving significant accuracy in classifying different brain tumor types based on MRI scans.  
- Analyzed model predictions and performance metrics to gain insights into classification accuracy and understand the key features contributing to brain tumor detection.
- Conducted extensive testing and validation of the model on unseen data, culminating in the successful deployment of an application capable of accurate and real-time brain tumor detection.
